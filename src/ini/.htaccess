# It is highly suggested to move credentials.ini to a directory not
# accessible by the public, such as /var/www/html on linux
#
# If you need to keep the credentials.ini accessible, ensure that you
# give the file '600' permissions '$ chmod 600 credentials.ini' and
# that you have this .htaccess file to deny access or redirect if accessed
